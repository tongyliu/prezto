Prezto, With Tong's Customizations
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes. This is a fork of the main project so that I don't lose my personal configuration.

Customization
-------------

The project is managed via [Git][3]. It is highly recommended that you fork this
project; so, that you can commit your changes and push them to [GitHub][4] to
not lose them. If you do not know how to use Git, follow this [tutorial][5] and
bookmark this [reference][6].

Resources
---------

The [Zsh Reference Card][7] and the [zsh-lovers][8] man page are indispensable.
